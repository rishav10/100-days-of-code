# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises of Basic Css in Resonsive Web Design on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was nice experience for Day 0 and I have applied what I learned in CSS and also I figured out how to commit and edit my files for #100DaysOfCode.

### Day 3: March 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have gone through and completed some of the exercises of Applied Visual Design in Resonsive Web Design on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** If it was not  a continuous task of completing minimum of 1hr of code daily and uploading it, then I would not have done it and I am happy that I did not break the streak.

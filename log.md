# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises of Basic Css in Resonsive Web Design on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was nice experience for Day 0 and I have applied what I learned in CSS and also I figured out how to commit and edit my files for #100DaysOfCode.
